My compact electric skateboard is my go-to for short commutes and quick errands — faster than walking and more fun than transit.

## Why I Can't Leave Without It

- Speeds up short commutes and saves time
- Folds or stows easily in the trunk or hallway
- Smooth, efficient electric motor with good range
- Small footprint compared to a bike
- It's enjoyable and reduces reliance on cars
