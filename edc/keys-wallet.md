# Keys & Wallet

{% badge "Paired" %}

I keep a compact key organizer paired with a slim wallet — together they give me access, identity, and payment without bulk.

## Why I Can't Leave Without Them

- Keys provide access to home and vehicle
- Slim wallet holds ID, one or two cards, and emergency cash
- Combined they keep pockets light and organized
- Quick-release key system makes it easy to share or remove items
- Durable construction means they last for years
